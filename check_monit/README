check_monit 0.1

This is a Nagios plugin written in perl which will check a monit server. The
script acepts port and host of the monit server and a list of services to check.
The list of services is optional, if it's not provided this plugin will check
all the services on the monit server.

The script yields OK if every service checked is running. If there's a service
in other state will exit with status CRITICAL informing the name of the first
failed checked service.

If there's no connection to the monit server the script will return a UNKNOW 
status, or a warning if there's a monitor specified by parameter that can be 
found

This software requires the following perl modules:

  - Nagios::Plugins
  - Munin::HTTP

First one part of the debian distribution under packages libnagios-plugins-perl
and the other is an small module wich can be installed thru CPAN. Other distros
may include these as well.
